### Issues
<br>
There where a lot of opsticles as I was doing this project but I will list some here!
I have had some visual problems with my eyes and most of the time I have not been able to see clearly.
I got help from CI studentcare and pushed my course up abit with medical certificate.
As we have been traveling while studying it has also made it hard to follow along the schedual.
When I came back home to Sweden my mother had to get to the hospital and I was with here during that time as she dont speak the language very well.
This is some personal issues I have had.
<br>
<br>

### BugFix
<br>
Had to do the changes again to my requirements.txt:
From - backports.zoneinfo==0.2.1
To - backports.zoneinfo==0.2.1;python_version<"3.9"
So that I could deploy/push to heroku
<br>
<br>

### Testing
I had errors apparing as I was testing and I googled to find out what to do. <br>
I found a way around that error by changing the DATABASES in settings.py. <br>
And I did as many tests that was possible for me at the finnishing days.
<br>
<br>
