Here is a link for you to go visit the page: [Fantasy Blog](https://fantasyblog-cae828f12eb7.herokuapp.com/)
<br>
<br>
This blog was developed by following along with Django Blog from the Code institute program.
During the development of this blog I filed the code and added code so that
it would suit my own needs for this blog.
<br>

### The Colors
I wanted to have a dark themed design with popping links. The specific colors resonate with how I have
seen fantasy themed websites before, so that´s why I chose the colors I have.

### The Images
The images on teh blog are found in different pages:

## Manual testing
Throughout this project I have manually tested if the design looks good and is working both on my computer and on mobile device. Throughout the buildup I´ve used the inspect tool to always see how the code affected the appearance of my site and if any errors occured in the console.
I´v used [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/) and I have looked for solution in [Slack](https://slack.com/) if I´ve come across any issues that I could not solve myself before contacting any tutor about the specific issue.
<br>
<br>
I´ve tested all of my code in validation services at the end of the project to find any errors or issues.
<br>
I´ve used LightHouse tool and got these results:

### Issues
There were a lot of personal obstacles as I was doing this project since I´ve had some visual problems with my eyes and most of the time developing this project I have not been able to see clearly. I got help from CI Studentcare and pushed my course up a bit. As I have been traveling while studying I´ve struggled with keeping up with the schedule. When arriving back home to Sweden I had a family member needing me to stay at the hospital for a long period of time and this also made it difficult for me to study without interruptions. This caused me to stress the first deployment and not finishing everything properly both within the code and the README.md file. Thanks to the accessor for the site feedback I´ve now been able to improve my code.

### Bugs
How it looked like:
<br>

How it looks like now:
<br>
![Footer](https://res.cloudinary.com/miswaq/image/upload/v1708866724/Fantasy/FixedFooter_obhi5t.png)
<br>
<br>
Icons at the bottom were not centering properly. I found that the ms-3 class was causing the icons to be pushed to the right and when I changed to ms-1 in class (Bootstrap) it looked better.

### Unfixed bugs
There are no unfixed bugs.

### Issues
<br>
There where a lot of opsticles as I was doing this project but I will list some here!
I have had some visual problems with my eyes and most of the time I have not been able to see clearly.
I got help from CI studentcare and pushed my course up abit with medical certificate.
As we have been traveling while studying it has also made it hard to follow along the schedual.
When I came back home to Sweden my mother had to get to the hospital and I was with here during that time as she dont speak the language very well.
This is some personal issues I have had.
<br>
<br>

### BugFix
<br>
Had to do the changes again to my requirements.txt:
From - backports.zoneinfo==0.2.1
To - backports.zoneinfo==0.2.1;python_version<"3.9"
So that I could deploy/push to heroku
<br>
<br>

### Testing
I had errors apparing as I was testing and I googled to find out what to do. <br>
I found a way around that error by changing the DATABASES in settings.py. <br>
And I did as many tests that was possible for me at the finnishing days.
<br>
