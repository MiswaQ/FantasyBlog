Fantasy Blog is a place that wish to deliver a taste of some good fantasy books.
<br>
Stories about Magic and Dragons!
<br>
The user is able to interact and connect with other users. To share their views by
commenting posting and show love by liking.
<br>
<br>
Here is a link for you to go visit the page: [Fantasy Blog](https://fantasyblog-cae828f12eb7.herokuapp.com/)
<br>
<br>
This blog was developed by following along with the Django Blog mini project from the Code Institute program.
During the development of this blog I filed the code and added code so that
it would suit my own needs for this blog.
<br>
<br>
The user can sign up in order to like, comment and edit their own comments on the blog post.
The admin can log in to create, read, update, approve, and delete posts and comments (CRUD)

1. Create an account
2. Login to page
3. Like a post
4. Comment a post
5. Edit my own comments
6. Delete my own comments

#### Creating the project in Gitpod

### The Colors
I wanted to have a dark themed design with popping links. The specific colors resonate with how I have
seen fantasy themed websites before, so that´s why I chose the colors I have.

### The Images
The images on the blog are found in different pages:

## Manual testing
Throughout this project I have manually tested if the design looks good and is working both on my computer and on mobile device. Throughout the buildup I´ve used the inspect tool to always see how the code affected the appearance of my site and if any errors occured in the console.
<br>
I've used [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/) and I have looked for solution in [Slack](https://slack.com/) if I´ve come across any issues that I could not solve myself before contacting any tutor about the specific issue.
<br>
<br>
I´ve tested all of my code in validation services at the end of the project to find any errors or issues.
Validation completed with no issues in W3C validation.

<br>

I´ve used [User Stories](https://github.com/users/MiswaQ/projects/8) to follow through with the planing and implementing:

<br>
I´ve used LightHouse tool and got these results:

### Issues
There were a lot of personal obstacles as I was doing this project since I´ve had some visual problems with my eyes and most of the time developing this project I have not been able to see clearly. I got help from CI Studentcare and pushed my course up a bit. As I have been traveling while studying I´ve struggled with keeping up with the schedule. When arriving back home to Sweden I had a family member needing me to stay at the hospital for a long period of time and this also made it difficult for me to study without interruptions. This caused me to stress the first deployment and not finishing everything properly both within the code and the README.md file. Thanks to the accessor for the site feedback I´ve now been able to improve my code.

### Bugs

**Icons at the bottom** were not centering properly. I found that the ms-3 class was causing the icons to be pushed to the right and when I changed to ms-1 in class (Bootstrap) it looked better.
<br>
<br>
How it looked like:

**The css was not loading properly**, after many attempts I finally realized that Cloudinary did not load the s†atic files when having the DeBug set to FALSE in my settings.py file. So I changed this when finishing my visual design.

<br>
<br>

I had problems **deploying to heroku** and found that there was an issue within requirements.txt.<br>
Had to do the changes to my requirements.txt:<br>
From - backports.zoneinfo==0.2.1<br>
To - backports.zoneinfo==0.2.1;python_version<"3.9"<br>
So that I could deploy/push to heroku

## Credit and Contact

### Code

I want to once again thank the assessor for the site feedback to improve my code. The improvements I´ve made based on this is:
 - Re-design the whole site to better suit the common purpose of the site. I´ve made a better flow with the colors and themes so that everything works and flows better design wise.
 - Added testing write-ups and more evidence of the manual testing.
 - Added images of my wireframe to the README.md file.
